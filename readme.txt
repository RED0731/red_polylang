Making WordPress multilingual

== Description ==

= Features  =

Polylang allows you to create a bilingual or multilingual WordPress site. You write posts, pages and create categories and post tags as usual, and then define the language for each of them. The translation of a post, whether it is in the default language or not, is optional.

* You can use as many languages as you want. RTL language scripts are supported. WordPress languages packs are automatically downloaded and updated.
* You can translate posts, pages, media, categories, post tags, menus, widgets...
* Custom post types, custom taxonomies, sticky posts and post formats, RSS feeds and all default WordPress widgets are supported.
* The language is either set by the content or by the language code in url, or you can use one different subdomain or domain per language
* Categories, post tags as well as some other metas are automatically copied when adding a new post or page translation
* A customizable language switcher is provided as a widget or in the nav menu
* The admin interface is of course multilingual too and each user can set the WordPress admin language in its profile

If you wish to migrate from WPML, you can use the plugin [WPML to Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpml-to-polylang/)

If you wish to use a professional or automatic translation service, you can install [Lingotek Translation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lingotek-translation/), as an addon of Polylang. Lingotek offers a complete translation management system which provides services such as translation memory or semi-automated translation processes (e.g. machine translation > human translation > legal review).

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you are using WordPress 4.0 or later and that your server is running PHP 5.2.4 or later (same requirement as WordPress itself)
1. If you tried other multilingual plugins, deactivate them before activating Polylang, otherwise, you may get unexpected results!
1. Install and activate the plugin as usual from the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to the languages settings page and create the languages you need
1. Add the 'language switcher' widget to let your visitors switch the language.
1. Take care that your theme must come with the corresponding .mo files (Polylang automatically downloads them when they are available for themes and plugins in this repository). If your theme is not internationalized yet, please refer to the [Theme Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/internationalization/) or ask the theme author to internationalize it.
